Travel Republic Front End Dev Technical Test
============================================

Take the attached data set hotels.json and write a web page (or simple set of pages) to present the data. 

The result set is reasonably large so we need to be be able to filter the data by:

* Name
* Stars
* TrpRating
* UserRating
* MinCost

and sort the data by:

* Distance
* Stars
* MinCost
* TrpRating
* UserRating

Things to consider - performance, efficient use of space, usability, cross-browser, responsiveness.

You can use whatever server side technology you like (or none at all if you think that’s appropriate). 
Just give us some instructions if you use anything *really* eccentric. 

You can use whatever frameworks or libraries you like, but be prepared to justify your use of them.

You should aim to get this test back to us within a day but there is no precise time limit.
